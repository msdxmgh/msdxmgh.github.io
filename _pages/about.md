I received my MESc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca) (Western University), London, ON. My research interests include the areas of soft robotics, human-robot interaction, and deep reinforcement learning. Please explore the rest of this website to learn more about me and my research.
