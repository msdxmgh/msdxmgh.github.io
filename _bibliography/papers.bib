  title={A Lightweight magnetorheological actuator using hybrid magnetization},
  author={Moghani, Masoud and Kermani, Mehrdad R},
  abstract={This article presents the design and validation of a lightweight magnetorheological (MR) clutch, called hybrid magnetorheological (HMR) clutch. The clutch utilizes a hybrid magnetization using an electromagnetic coil and a permanent magnet. The electromagnetic coil can adjust the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet to a desired value and fully control the transmitted torque. To achieve the maximum torque-to-mass ratio, the design of the HMR clutch is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem with three design objectives, namely the transmitted torque, the mass of the clutch, and the magnetic field strength within the clutch pack. A prototype of the HMR clutch is fabricated, and its dynamic performance is experimentally validated. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the HMR clutch in applications requiring fast and precise motion and torque control.},

  title={Design and development of a hybrid magneto-rheological clutch for safe robotic applications},
  author={Moghani, Masoud and Kermani, Mehrdad R},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a new concept for generating magnetic field in Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches intended for safe robotic applications. The main rationale behind this concept is to divide the magnetic field generation into two parts using an electromagnetic coil and a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet generates a bias magnetic field density at the optimum working point of the MR clutch while the energized coil can add or negate the magnetic field to a desired value. The results will show clear advantages of this concept in reducing the total weight of the MR clutch, improving the torque-to-mass ratio, and reducing electrical power consumption. The proposed concept is validated using computer model of an MR clutch and Finite Element Method (FEM) is hired to compare the characteristics of the proposed MR clutch with those from conventional coil based clutch. Experimental results will be provided to further validate the advantages of the proposed new concept.},

  title={Hysteresis modeling of a hybrid magneto-rheological actuator},
  author={Moghani, Masoud and Kermani, Mehrdad R},
  abstract={A hybrid MR clutch utilizes a permanent magnet and an electromagnetic coil to generate the magnetic field within the clutch pack. The existence of nonlinear hysteretic behavior between the input and output of the MR clutches needs to be fully investigated in order to perform high fidelity force/torque control. In this paper, a closed-loop torque control strategy is presented. The feedback signal used in the closed-loop control is estimated using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that uses magnetic field measurements from an embedded Hall sensor inside the clutch. The developed neural network is capable of accurately predicting the transmitted torque as well as modeling the hysteretic relationship between the applied current, internal magnetic field within the clutch, and the output torque of the actuator. This technique introduces a cost effective force/torque control by eliminating the need for conventional torque sensors for providing feedback. The performance of the trained neural network and the said control strategy are experimentally validated. The results clearly show the ability of a hybrid MR clutch in delivering torque tracking control with high fidelity required in many human-safe actuation systems.},
